# Market Basket Analysis : Case Study

Market Basket Analysis is a data-driven technique used to uncover patterns and relationships within large transactional datasets, particularly in retail and e-commerce. It helps businesses understand which products or items are often purchased together, providing insights for optimizing product placement, marketing strategies, and promotions.

The dataset provided contains transactional data, with columns representing:

- BillNo: A unique identifier for each customerâ€™s bill.
- Itemname: The name of the purchased item.
- Quantity: The quantity of the item purchased.
- Price: The price of each item.
- CustomerID: A unique identifier for each customer.


Perform a Market Basket Analysis on the given dataset to discover associations between purchased items. Specifically, the goal is to identify:

- *Which items are frequently purchased together by customers.*
- *The strength of these associations (e.g., support, confidence, lift).*

### Process We can follow

- Gather transactional data, including purchase history, shopping carts, or invoices.
- Analyze product sales and trends.
- Use algorithms like Apriori or FP-growth to discover frequent item sets and generate association rules.
- Interpret the discovered association rules to gain actionable insights.
- Develop strategies based on the insights gained from the analysis.
